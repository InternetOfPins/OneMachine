/**
 * @file action.h
 * @brief An action = 3 services + 2 topics + a bounded goal table + a
 *        pure state-transition function. No new primitive.
 *
 * Mirrors rcl_action's own structure: `rcl_action_client_impl_t` is
 * literally { goal_client, cancel_client, result_client : rcl_client_t;
 * feedback_subscription, status_subscription : rcl_subscription_t }. The
 * goal lifecycle is `rcl_action_transition_goal_state(state, event)` — a
 * pure function that constant-folds to a branch cascade here.
